Study of the effect of using different algorithms of Superpixels Segmentation in the Pipeline presented in the work of Hernan Carrillo, Michaël Clément and Aurélie
Bugeau, from the paper “Super-attention for exemplar-based image colorization”.
The algorithms that I was able to explore are the following: SLIC (the one used in the paper), SSN (Superpixel Sampling Network), SH (Superpixel Hierarchy), as well as briefly SCALP (Superpixel Linear Path), LSC (Linear Spectral Clustering) and SL (Superpixel Lattice).
